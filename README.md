# safeMeals_website_backend
This repository will show you how to use the backend repository to create a basic backend server for the SafeMeals Website. 
We use express, postgres as our database, heroku for hosting as well as sequelize.
To integrate with the front end, we will use CORS as our middleware to connect the node app to the front end repository.

## Requirements 
The following requirements must be installed:
1. postgres
2. node
3. heroku 
4. sequelize

## Security of Partner's data
We hosted it on a separate server so that the database will not be easily accessible.

This repository will be updated along as well.
